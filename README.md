As part of the Capstone, I will be doing a POC around the setup of a Kubernetes cluster on cloud and managing applications on Kubernetes. The POC will involve the following goals:

1. Basic VPC setup for a Kubernetes cluster on AWS
2. EKS cluster setup using eksctl
3. Stateless & Stateful workload on Kubernetes
4. Metrics system for Kubernetes
5. Autoscaling nodes & workload on Kubernetes
